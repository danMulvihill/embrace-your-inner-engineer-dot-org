<h1>Communicating with Electromagnetic Waves</h1>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the Internet was not invented in 1969, or even the 20th century. The world as we know it today began it's transformation way back in the 19th century when people learned to harness electricity for the purpose of sending messages. The Internet is a descendant of two centuries of telegraph, and later telephone, cable that allow us to send messages instantaneously from one part of the world to another. Until then, we were limited by how fast we can send letters: horse-drawn carriages, boats, trains, airplanes. Even today, a message sent by wire beats the fastest airplane by a few hours.</p>
<p>To be fair, this "wired" technology is still limited. We would only be online if we connected a wire to the device (a laptop, a cellphone, etc.) that can read the messages. Other people in the 19th century (sometimes the same people) figured out how to send electrical signals across the air without wires. By the 1880s, it was worked out that you can create an electromagnetic device - a transmitter - to send radiation to another device  - a receiver, and this radiation was kind of like light we can't see. It was, in fact, light with different physical properties: longer waves and slower frequencies. We now refer to these low frequency light waves as radio waves, and know radio waves, light, and higher frequency shorter waves like X-rays and gamma rays to be part of a broader phenomenon known as the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>One the persons who worked out the details of transporting radio signals, and proved that they exist, was a German physicist named Heinrich Hertz. For his efforts, he had the unit of electromagnetic wave frequency named after him. Hertz was famous for not seeing any practical value for radio waves. It wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th century that others used radio to send data through the air. Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian inventor working for a British telegraph company, sent the first radio signal across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901.</p>
<p>Today, radio and "wireless" technology supplement the "wired" backbone of the Internet. In addition to AM/FM radio and older television technology (remember VHF and UHF dials?), we use radio waves for a wide variety of purposes, from connecting to a router at Starbucks, turning the channel with a remote control, sending signals to satellites 12,000 miles in outer-space to predict the weather, to communicate with astronauts in space stations, or to help us navigate.</p></div>
